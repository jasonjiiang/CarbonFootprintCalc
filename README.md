# CarbonFootprintCalc

Website that calculates the carbon footprint according to the information submitted by the user which will give a formatted output for the user to view.

This was done as part of a student project with the primary purpose of this project being that everyone would get to understand how to work within a team in the professional world. As well as being able to learn some new tricks and technologies along the way such as getting better or learning a new framework/software. Whereas in this case, it was mainly learning a CSS framework (Bootstrap) version control system (Git) and a service/platform that utilises Git (this platform).
